# Why Agent-Sandbox?

When we are developing AI Agents, one of the critical challenges is providing an Enterprise-Grade&Production-Grade environment for executing untrusted code and performing various tasks, that is **Multi-Session and Multi-Tenant**.

Sandbox must be isolated on a **Per-Agent** even **Per-User** basis to ensure security and prevent interference **between different conversation or task**. Additionally, the sandbox environment should support state persistence, allowing agents to maintain context and data across multiple interactions or multi agents etc.

Therefore, **Multi-Session and Multi-Tenant** is very critical,  Each sandbox is isolated on a per-agent or per-user basis, ensuring security and preventing interference between different conversations or tasks.

I found [kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) leverages [AIO Sandbox](https://github.com/agent-infra/sandbox) and Kubernetes to provide a similar solution. But it seems not friendly for AI Agents to manage the sandbox lifecycle and not friendly for commonly users to use it, because it faces to Kubernetes directly.

So, We decide created this **Agent-Sandbox** project, which provides a RESTful API and MCP(Model Context Protocol) server to manage the sandbox lifecycle easily. It abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes and provides a simple interface for AI Agents and users to create, access, and delete sandboxes as needed. And we refer to some design ideas from [Blaxel Sandbox](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Sandboxes/Overview) and [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) provide similar features like lifecycle management and API design. Making it more suitable for AI Agents to use, but is opensource and self-hosted.

# Features
- **Ai-First** - Agents automatically manage whole Sandbox's lifecycle by the MCP( Model Context Protocol ) , making it easy to manage various Sandbox environments and access them automatically.
- **AI-Agent Runtimes** - Supports various AI agent runtimes, including code execution, browser automation, computer use, and shell command execution and easy to customize more runtimes.
- **Enterprise-Grade** - Support multiple Sandbox lifecycle manage for each tenant or session, allowing Agents to run different tasks simultaneously without interference for different tenant or session.
- **Cloud-Native** - Leverages Kubernetes built to run in cloud environments, leveraging the benefits of cloud infrastructure such as scalability, flexibility, resilience and efficient resource management.
- **Fast and Lightweight** - Designed to be lightweight and fast, minimizing Kubernetes's objects to deploy. easy to use and maintain.

# Quick Start

## 1, Installation
You can install Agent-Sandbox by applying the provided [install.yaml](https://github.com/agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox/blob/main/install.yaml) file to your Kubernetes cluster.  

requires **Kubernetes version 1.26** or higher.
```bash
kubectl create namespace agent-sandbox
kubectl apply -nagent-sandbox -f install.yaml
```
You can create an ingress or port-forward to access the Agent-Sandbox API server. Ingress like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: agent-sandbox
  namespace: agent-sandbox
spec:
  ingressClassName: ingress-nginx
  rules:
  - host: agent-sandbox.your-host.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: agent-sandbox
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /(.*)
```
Now you can access the Agent-Sandbox API server at `http://agent-sandbox.your-host.com`.

## 2, Usage
The Agent-Sandbox provides a RESTful API or MCP to manage sandboxes. The typical workflow involves creating a sandbox, accessing it, and then deleting it when no longer needed.

```


### 2.1, Use Agent-Sandbox MCP Server
You can manage sandboxes using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with your AI Agents. The MCP server allows Agents to create, access, and delete sandboxes automatically.

MCP Server Address: `http://agent-sandbox.your-host.com/mcp`. Now support SSE(Streamable-http).

#### MCP Demos:

##### 1, Code Execution

Agents automatically create a sandbox when code needs to be executed and delete it when execution completes, ensuring isolated and secure code runs.

[code execution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ee410f-e12c-4c40-9dcc-f16b3b1abade)


##### 2, Browser Use

Agents automatically create a sandbox when website access is needed and delete it when the task is finished, providing isolated browser sessions for web interactions.

[browser use](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e75daeb0-2bce-4144-9c2e-9c7979c21a05)


This MCP integration enables agents to manage sandbox resources without manual intervention, supporting multi-session and multi-tenant operations with automatic cleanup.

---

### 2.2, Use RESTful API
You can also manage sandboxes manually using the RESTful API provided by Agent-Sandbox.

#### I, Create a Sandbox
You can create a new sandbox by sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/sandbox` endpoint with the desired configuration. For example, to create an `aio` environment sandbox and name it `sandbox-01`, you can use the following curl command or programmatically call the API:

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Shell**
```shell
curl --location '/api/v1/sandbox' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"name":"sandbox-01"}'
```
for China user, please specify the local aio image registry to improve the pull speed:
```shell
curl --location '/api/v1/sandbox' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"name":"sandbox-01","image":"enterprise-public-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/vefaas-public/all-in-one-sandbox:latest"}'
```

</td>
<td>

**Python**
```python
import requests
import json

url = "/api/v1/sandbox"

payload = json.dumps({
  "name": "sandbox-01"
})
headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result**
```json
{
    "code": "0",
    "data": "Sandbox sandbox-01 created successfully"
}
```

#### II, Access to Sandbox
`/sandbox/{sandbox_name}` endpoint to get the access of the sandbox, including the connection details such as URL, WebSocket URL, VNC URL, or other relevant information based on the sandbox environment type.

Now you can access to the previously created **sandbox-01** sandbox using `/sandbox/sandbox-01`.

**You will see:**
![aio-demo.jpg](docs/aio-demo.jpg)

**Use agent sandbox SDK access this sandbox:**
```python
from agent_sandbox import Sandbox

# Initialize client
client = Sandbox(base_url="http://agent-sandbox.your-host.com/sandbox/sandbox-01")
home_dir = client.sandbox.get_context().home_dir

# Execute shell commands
result = client.shell.exec_command(command="ls -la")
print(result.data.output)

# File operations
content = client.file.read_file(file=f"{home_dir}/.bashrc")
print(content.data.content)

# Browser automation
screenshot = client.browser.screenshot()
```

And this created Sandbox's MCP Server address is: `/sandbox/sandbox-01/mcp`. you can use this MCP Server with your AI Agent to access this sandbox.

For more usage, please refer to: https://github.com/agent-infra/sandbox

#### III, Delete a Sandbox
You can delete a sandbox by sending a DELETE request to the `/api/v1/sandbox/{sandbox_name}` endpoint. For example, to delete the `sandbox-01` sandbox, you can use the following curl command or programmatically call the API:


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Shell**
```shell
curl --location --request DELETE '/api/v1/sandbox/sandbox-01'
```

</td>
<td>

**Python**
```python
import requests

url = "/api/v1/sandbox/sandbox-01"

headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("DELETE", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Result:**

```json
{
    "code": "0",
    "data": "Sandbox sandbox-01 deleted successfully"
}
```
